# üå§Ô∏è WeatherApp

WeatherApp is a weather forecast application built using **SwiftUI**, **Combine**, and REST APIs. It provides users with detailed weather information for their current location and saved cities, offering both **light** and **dark modes** for better user experience.

## üöÄ Features

- **Current Location Forecast**  
  The app fetches weather data for your current location using Core Location and reverse geocoding.

- **Search for Cities**  
  Easily search and add cities using the search bar integrated with Apple's **MapKit** for accurate location data.

- **Saved Cities List**  
  Save multiple cities and view their real-time weather data, including:
  - Temperature
  - Feels Like
  - High and Low Temperatures

- **Hourly and Daily Forecast**  
  View hourly forecasts and a 5-day weather outlook with percentage rain probability.

- **Light and Dark Mode**  
  Adaptive UI to match system settings for light and dark themes.

- **iCloud Sync**  
  All saved cities are synchronized via **iCloud** to ensure data persistence across devices.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **SwiftUI**: For building declarative and dynamic UI components.
- **Combine**: To manage asynchronous data flow and bind the UI to the weather data.
- **REST APIs**: Integrated with OpenWeatherMap (or similar API) to fetch weather forecasts.
- **Core Location**: To fetch the user's current location.
- **MapKit**: For city search and geolocation.
- **iCloud**: Used for saving and syncing the list of cities across multiple devices.

## üîë API Integration

The app fetches weather data from a REST API (OpenWeatherMap). Ensure the following endpoints are configured:

1. **Current Weather**:  
   ```
   https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q={city}&appid=YOUR_API_KEY
   ```

2. **Forecast**:  
   ```
   https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast?q={city}&appid=YOUR_API_KEY
   ```

## üéØ Future Enhancements

- Implement widgets to display weather data on the home screen.
- Add offline support with local caching.
- Integrate weather alerts for severe conditions.
